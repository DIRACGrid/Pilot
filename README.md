# Dirac Pilots

The Dirac interware is a software framework for distributed computing, 
providing a complete solution to one or more user community requiring access to distributed resources.
Dirac builds a layer between the users and the resources offering a common interface to a number of heterogeneous providers,
integrating them in a seamless manner, providing interoperability, at the same time as an optimized, transparent and reliable usage of the resources.

The Pilot repository is an independent part of the Dirac system dedicated to the development of Dirac Pilots.

Contributing to DIRAC/Pilot
===========================

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

Feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

Repository structure
====================

Due to the fact that we support only the production and the development versions,
for now only 2 branchs are present: *master*, and *devel*. 

* *master* is the stable branch.
* *devel* is the development branch.

Issue Tracking
==============

Issue tracking for the project is [here in github](https://github.com/DIRACGrid/Pilot/issues).
